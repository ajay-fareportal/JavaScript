                Introduction to React JS
            </h1>
            <hr>
            <p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets
                you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
            </p>
            <p><b>Let us understand this with a practical example.</b>
                <br>
                Let’s say one of your friends posted a photograph on Facebook. Now you go and like the image and then
                you started checking out the comments too. Now while you are browsing over comments you see that the
                likes count has increased by 100, since you liked the picture, even without reloading the page. This
                magical count change is because of Reactjs.
